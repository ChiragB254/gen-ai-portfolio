# Building a Modern Portfolio with Next.js and TypeScript

Creating a personal portfolio website is one of the most rewarding projects for any developer. It's your chance to showcase your skills, personality, and professional journey in a unique way. In this post, I'll walk you through the process of building a modern, interactive portfolio using Next.js and TypeScript.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js has become the go-to framework for React applications, and for good reason:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Improves SEO and initial load times
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Perfect for portfolio sites
- **API Routes**: Built-in backend functionality
- **Image Optimization**: Automatic image optimization and lazy loading
- **TypeScript Support**: First-class TypeScript integration

## Project Structure

```

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Responsive Design

The portfolio is built with a mobile-first approach, ensuring it looks great on all devices. Using CSS Grid and Flexbox, along with Tailwind CSS for rapid styling.

### 2. Dynamic Content

Instead of hardcoded content, the portfolio fetches data from various APIs:

- GitHub API for repository information
- Real-time system stats
- Blog posts from markdown files

### 3. Interactive Components

The portfolio includes several interactive elements:

- Animated hero section
- Project filtering system
- Live coding environment preview
- Real-time GitHub activity feed

### 4. Performance Optimization

- Image optimization with Next.js Image component
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Optimized fonts with Google Fonts
- Minimal bundle size

## Technical Implementation

### GitHub API Integration

```typescript
export async function getGitHubStats(username: string) {
  try {
    const [userResponse, reposResponse] = await Promise.all([
      fetch(`https://api.github.com/users/${username}`),
      fetch(`https://api.github.com/users/${username}/repos?sort=updated&per_page=100`)
    ]);

    const user = await userResponse.json();
    const repos = await reposResponse.json();

    return {
      totalRepos: user.public_repos,
      totalStars: repos.reduce((sum, repo) => sum + repo.stargazers_count, 0),
      followers: user.followers,
      following: user.following
    };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching GitHub stats:', error);
    return null;
  }
}
```

### Blog System

The portfolio includes a full-featured blog system that:

- Parses markdown files with frontmatter
- Generates static pages for each post
- Supports categories and tags
- Calculates reading time
- Handles pinned posts

### System Monitoring

A simulated system monitoring component shows:

- CPU and memory usage
- Network activity
- Storage information
- GPU utilization

## Challenges and Solutions

### 1. TypeScript Configuration

Setting up TypeScript with Next.js required careful configuration of:

- Strict mode settings
- Path mapping for imports
- Type definitions for external libraries

### 2. API Rate Limiting

GitHub's API has rate limits, so I implemented:

- Caching strategies
- Error handling
- Fallback data

### 3. SEO Optimization

Ensuring good SEO involved:

- Proper meta tags
- Structured data
- Sitemap generation
- Performance optimization

## Deployment

The portfolio is deployed on Vercel, which provides:

- Automatic deployments from GitHub
- Edge network distribution
- Analytics and performance monitoring
- Custom domain support

## Future Enhancements

Some planned improvements include:

- [ ] Dark/light theme toggle
- [ ] Contact form with email integration
- [ ] Project detail pages
- [ ] Blog comments system
- [ ] Analytics dashboard

## Conclusion

Building a portfolio with Next.js and TypeScript has been an excellent learning experience. The combination of modern web technologies, great developer experience, and deployment ease makes it an ideal choice for personal projects.

The key to a great portfolio is not just showcasing your technical skills, but also telling your story and making it easy for visitors to understand who you are as a developer.
