## Introduction

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as one of the most powerful patterns for building LLM applications. In this guide, we'll explore how to build a production-ready RAG system from scratch.

## What is RAG?

RAG combines the power of large language models with external knowledge retrieval. Instead of relying solely on the model's training data, RAG systems:

1. Retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base
2. Augment the prompt with this context
3. Generate responses based on both the retrieved information and the model's knowledge

## Architecture Overview

A typical RAG system consists of several key components:

### 1. Document Processing

```python
def process_documents(documents):
    # Split documents into chunks
    chunks = chunk_documents(documents)
    
    # Generate embeddings
    embeddings = embed_chunks(chunks)
    
    # Store in vector database
    store_embeddings(chunks, embeddings)
```

### 2. Retrieval

When a user asks a question:

```python
def retrieve_context(query, k=5):
    # Embed the query
    query_embedding = embed_text(query)
    
    # Find similar chunks
    results = vector_db.search(query_embedding, k=k)
    
    return results
```

### 3. Generation

```python
def generate_response(query, context):
    prompt = f"""
    Context: {context}
    
    Question: {query}
    
    Answer:
    """
    
    return llm.generate(prompt)
```

## Key Considerations

### Chunking Strategy

The way you chunk your documents significantly impacts retrieval quality:

- **Fixed-size chunks**: Simple but may split semantic units
- **Sentence-based**: Preserves semantic meaning
- **Paragraph-based**: Maintains context but may be too large

### Vector Database Selection

Choose based on your needs:

| Database | Best For | Pros | Cons |
|----------|----------|------|------|
| FAISS | Local development | Fast, free | No persistence |
| Qdrant | Production | Feature-rich | Requires setup |
| Pinecone | Cloud-first | Managed service | Costs $ |

### Embedding Models

Popular choices:

- **OpenAI Ada-002**: High quality, but costs add up
- **Sentence Transformers**: Free, open-source
- **Custom models**: Fine-tuned for your domain

## Production Tips

> Always implement proper error handling and fallbacks in production RAG systems.

Here are some best practices:

1. **Implement caching** to reduce API costs
2. **Monitor retrieval quality** with evaluation metrics
3. **Use hybrid search** (keyword + semantic)
4. **Implement re-ranking** for better results

## Conclusion

Building a RAG system requires careful consideration of many factors. Start simple, measure performance, and iterate based on your specific use case.

### Next Steps

- Experiment with different chunking strategies
- Try various embedding models
- Implement evaluation metrics
- Add caching and monitoring
